# AME QA Engineer Challenge

## Installing dependencies to run the project.

Basically this project is divided into three repositories: <b>ame-backend</b>, <b>ame-frontend</b> and <b>ame-mobile</b> <br>

But it's together in a unique repository using the Github subtree.<br>

All private information by architecture (mobile, rear or front) is described in as much detail as possible. Any questions, the repository is open for forks and new commits. :)<br>
